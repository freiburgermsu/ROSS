iROSSpy 
--------------

The essential functionality of ROSSpy has been adapted into an interactive Notebook through MyBinder. The Notebook cell is executed, which launches the script and provides a series of inquiries that intuitively guide the user through designing, executing, and/or processing a ROSSpy simulation. The results are conveniently printed to the Notebook console. This software capacity is intended to support non-technical investigators who still desire to simulate scaling and brine formation from desalination.
