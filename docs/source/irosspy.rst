The essential functionality of ROSSpy has been adapted into an interactive Notebook through MyBinder. The Notebook cell allows the investigator to execute the script and intuitively design, execute, and/or process a ROSSpy simulation through the Notebook console, where the simulation results are conveniently printed. This Binder is intended to support non-technical investigators who still desire to simulate scaling and brine formation from desalination without using an API.
